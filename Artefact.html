				<p>The wheels are designed such that they are effectively frictionless in one axis. This is achieved by mounting a set of smaller perpendicular wheels around the circumference. These smaller wheels are free to turn even when the main wheel is held still, allowing a free component of motion along the axis of the wheel. At the same time, the wheel can be powered as normal wheel.</p>
				<p>The small wheels in my design are washers. These are sufficient, as the sharp edge of the washer provides plenty of friction in the direction of drive, and the perpendicular friction is faily low. Additionally, washers are cheap!</p>
				<p>The axles for the washers needs to be a ring. The easiest way to get a ring is from a keychain. The ones the wheels use is a  <a href="http://onestop-key-rings.co.uk/51mm-split-rings-pack-of-10-p-11.html">5.1mm split ring from onestop-key-rings.co.uk</a></p>
				<p>The next thing needed is a way of holding the split ring onto the motor shaft. This was done with a circular laser-cut aluminum hub, held onto the split ring with cable ties.</p>
				<p>The most time consuming part of this aspect of the artefact was designing the aluminum hub. This is partly because of the accuracy required. A technical drawing program was used to design this. The design went through multiple sizes, as the measurements of the washers and split ring were gradually improved. The final design was set off to <a href="http://www.microkerf.com/">microkerf</a>, where it was laser cut in 4mm aluminum</p>

				<h3>Rotation</h3>
				<p>The formula for the velocity \(v\) of a point of distance \(r\) from the center of rotation, rotating at an angular velocity of \(\omega\) is given by the equation:</p>
				$$v = r\omega$$
				<p>However, this equation is of limited use. Thinking back to the straight-line driving, it is much more convenient if the variables can be expressed as vectors. It can be seen that the velocity of a point displaced \(\mathbf{r}\) from the center of rotation is a tangent to the circular motion, ie \(\mathbf{v}\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{r}\).</p>
				<p>From this information, the following equation can be derived:</p>
				$$\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{r}^\perp \times \omega$$
