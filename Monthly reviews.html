			<h1>Monthly reviews</h1>

				<h2>Jan - Feb:</h2>
				<p>
					Progress is somewhat slow. It's hard to see how much research need to be done, as each piece of research leads to two more pieces being required. Hopefully, I can reach the edges of this knownledge "tree" in the near future.</p>
				<p>
					I'm pleased with how the navigation softare worked out, and had the opportunity to test it on the HRSFC robotics team's (Systemetric) robot. It worked very well, and hopefully will work on the much smaller robocup robot. I didn't get a chance to write the control loop code, as Systemetric's robot did not have a compass.</p>
				<p>
					It's been bery hard to find appropriate wheels, as the type I want don't seem to exist on the internet, and the ones that are similar don't seem compatible with any suitable motors. I would quite like to have a go at custom manufacturing them.</p>
				<p>
					I do feel that I may be falling behind a little. It's frustrating not having any parts to experiment with.</p>

				<h2>Mar - Apr:</h2>
				<p>
					I feel progress went really well these months. Going to the robocup UK finals provided plenty of information about the design of other team's robots.</p>
				<p>
					I fear the PCB route may be an expensive and time consuming dead end. The online PCB services make it nightmarish to get quotes, the pricing is unclear, and above all, I don't really know what I'm doing. On balance, I think I'll switch over to using stripboard, since it's cheaper, modifyable, and faster.</p>
				<p>
					The wheel solution I came up with looks like it's going to work. After a suggestion from my teammate to use split-rings from keychains as the axles, the degin became obvious. Additionally, it looks affordable. I feel the design process moved along fairly quickly, which I'm pleased with.	Hopefully, it can be ordered fairly painlessly, and all the parts will just work together.</p>
				<p>
					Getting the shopping list mostly complete is a big plus. Most of the parts have been ordered, and will hopefully arrive soon. When that happens, the design process can stop being theoretical.</p>
