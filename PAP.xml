				Had another meeting with teammate.	Continued to experiment with shielding, to no gain.

				Shielding is required in order to made the view of the IR sensors directional. Without shielding, the strength of the signal is independant of sensor orientation.

				Finalized motor driver design. Did some research on how you actually cut stripboard, then actually cut the stripboard.

				Cut, drilled, and filed all 6 motor driver boards. Soldered components onto one. Left the others until design proven.

				Tested the compass, found bugs, and fixed bugs. Working properly. Few obscure bits of the datasheet might be worth implementing, but it's not too important
