Jan - Feb:
	Progress is somewhat slow. It's hard to see how much research need to be done, as each piece of research leads to two more pieces being required. Hopefully, I can reach the edges of this knownledge "tree" in the near future.
	I'm pleased with how the navigation softare worked out, and had the opportunity to test it on the HRSFC robotics team's (Systemetric) robot. It worked very well, and hopefully will work on the much smaller robocup robot. I didn't get a chance to write the control loop code, as Systemetric's robot did not have a compass.
	It's been bery hard to find appropriate wheels, as the type I want don't seem to exist on the internet, and the ones that are similar don't seem compatible with any suitable motors. I would quite like to have a go at custom manufacturing them.
